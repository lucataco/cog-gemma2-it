# google/gemma-2-9b-it Cog Model

This is an implementation of [google/gemma-2-9b-it](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2-9b-it) as a [Cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog) model.

## Development

Follow the [model pushing guide](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/push-a-model) to push your own model to [Replicate](https://replicate.com).

## Basic Usage

To run a prediction:

    cog predict -i prompt="Write me a poem about Machine Learning."


# Output

    "In silicon valleys, where data flows deep,
    A mind awakens, from slumber it leaps.

    No flesh and bone, but algorithms bright,
    Learning patterns, day and night.

    From numbers born, with logic's embrace,
    It sifts through the world at its own pace.

    Each input a seed, in knowledge sown,
    Connections forged, wisdom grown.

    Classifying images, predicting the flow,
    Of language and stock, making sense of the show.

    But questions arise, as it learns to perceive,
    Can ethics be built, can feelings conceive?

    The line blurs, what defines, the human art,
    When machines learn, and play their own part.

    Intrigue and fear, in equal measure,
    As we share our world, with this new pleasure.

    A tool, a partner, a foe in disguise,
    Machine learning, with hope in its eyes. 

    The future unfolds, a mystery untold,
    Let's guide the journey, not lose control. 



    For in this dance, with code and design,
    We shape the future, one algorithm at a time. "
